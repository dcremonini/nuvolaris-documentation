= Upload Web Assets
TODO

// == Static frontend

// The `web` folder in the root of a project is used to deploy static frontends. A static front-end is a collection of static asset under a given folder that will be published in a web server under a path.

// The path that will serve the static asset is determined by:
// * Hostname
// * Location of the asset

// === Hostname

// In general, for each namespace, there will be a `https://<namespace>.<domain>` website where to publish the resources. For the local deployment, there will be a website `http://127.0.0.1:8080` where the resources are published, with the namespace and the domain ignored.

// === Path detection

// The path where the assets are published depends on the path in the `web` hierarchy.

// The sub-folder `web` is published as "/".

// Any subfolder `web` under `packages/<package>/web` is published under `/<packages>/`.

// Any subfolder `web` under `packages/default/<action>\web` is published as `/<action>`.

// Any subfolder `web` under `packages/<package>/<action>/web` is published as `/<package>/<action>`

// What is published (files collected) and how it is built is defined by the next paragraph.

// === Building and Collecting

// In every folder `web` it will check if there is a `nuvolaris.json`

// If there is not a `nuvolaris.json` and not a `package.json` it will assume this base `nuvolaris.json`:

// ----
// {
//   "collect": ".",
//   "install": "echo nothing to install",
//   "build": "echo nothing to build"
// }
// ----

// If instead there is `packages.json`, it will assume this base `nuvolaris.json`:

// ----
// {
//   "collect": "public",
//   "install": "npm install",
//   "build": "npm run build"
// }
// ----

// Then it will read the `nuvolaris.json` replacing the keys in it with the default ones.

// The generated taskfile will execute at the deployment step:

// * the command defined by `install` only if there is not a `node_modules`
// * the command defined by `build` always
// * then it will collect for publishing (creating a crd instance) the files in the folder defined by `collect`

// It is recommended that `nuv scan` does not execute directly the command but instead, it delegates to another command like `nuv build` and in turn the creation of `crd` to another `nuv crd` subcommand, after changing to the corresponding subfolder. All those commands should work by default in the current folder. 

// == The Complete Mapping

// To summarize, the mapping for packages is:

// [cols="3*", options="header"]
// |===
// | Folder Name | Nuvolaris Package | Type
// | Root directory |  | 
// | packages |  | 
// | packages/<package_name> | <package_name> | Nuvolaris Package
// | <file_name> | default | Single File Action
// | packages/<package_name>/<file_name> | <package_name> | Single File Action
// | packages/<package_name>/<subfolder_name> | <package_name> | Multi File Action
// |===

// And the mapping for web folders is:

// [cols="2*", options="header"]
// |===
// | Folder Name | Endpoint
// | Root directory | 
// | web | `/`
// | packages/<package_name>/web | `/<package_name>/`
// | packages/<default>/<action_name>/web | `packages/default/<action_name>\web`
// | packages/<package_name>/<action_name>web | `/<package>/<action>`
// |===
