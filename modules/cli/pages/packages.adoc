=  Packages

Nuvolaris groups actions and feeds in  *packages*  under a namespace.  A package lets you to:

* group related actions together
* share parameters and annotations (each action sees the parameters assigned to the package) 
* provide to web actions a common prefix in the URL to invoke them.

We can for example create a package `demo-package` and assign a parameter:

----
$ wsk package create demo-package -p email no-reply@nuvolaris.io
ok: created package demo-package
----

Let's go on with the commands to list, get informations, update it and finally delete a package:

----
$ nuv package list
packages
/mirella/demo-package/demo-action                               private
$ nuv package update demo-package -p email info@nuvolaris.io
ok: updated package demo-package
$ nuv package get demo-package -s                     
package /mirella/demo-package/sample: Returns a result based on parameter email
   (parameters: *email)
$ nuv package delete demo-package
ok: deleted package demo-package
----

Note the `-s` flag to mean `summarize`.
