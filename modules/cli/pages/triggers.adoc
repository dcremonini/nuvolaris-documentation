=  Triggers 

Now let's see how to create a trigger. 

A trigger is merely a name for an arbitrary event. A trigger by itself does nothing. However with the help of rules, it becomes useful, because when a trigger is activated, it invokes all the associated rules, as shown in <<triggers>>.

Let's build now an example to see what triggers do. We use a simple action that does nothing except logging its activation. We use it to trace what is happening when you activate triggers. Note we start to construct the example now, but we complete it after we introduced rules, in the next paragraph.

So, let's prepare our example, deploying first a simple `log.js` actions, that just logs its name:

----
function main(args) {
  console.log(args.name)
  return {}
}
----

Then, we  deploy it twice, with two different names:

----
$ wsk action update basics/log-alpha -p name alpha basics/log.js
ok: updated action basics/log-alpha
$ wsk action update basics/log-beta -p name beta basics/log.js
ok: updated action basics/log-alpha
----

By themselves, those actions do nothing except leaving a trace of their activation in the logs:

----
$ wsk action invoke basics/log-alpha                 <1>
ok: invoked /_/basics/log-alpha with id 320b50d841064d0b8b50d841060d0bff
$ wsk action invoke basics/log-beta                  <2>
ok: invoked /_/basics/log-beta with id 990d284f090c45328d284f090c45320d
$ wsk activation list --limit 2                      <3>
activations 
990d284f090c45328d284f090c45320d log-beta
320b50d841064d0b8b50d841060d0bff log-alpha
$ wsk activation poll --since-seconds 60 --exit 20   <4>
Enter Ctrl-c to exit.

]
Activation: 'log-alpha' (e92e4466ee8f4684ae4466ee8f6684da)

]
----
<1> invoking the action `log-alpha`
<2> invoking the action `log-beta`
<3> showing a list of activations
<4> poll the activations (since 60 seconds, for 20 seconds) to see which activations happened and what they logged

Now we are ready to create a trigger, using the command `wsk trigger create` as in <<creating-trigger>>.

[NOTE]
Of course, there is not only `create` but also `update` and  `delete`, and they work as expected, updating and deleting triggers. In the next paragraph, we see also the `fire` command, that needs you first create rules to do something useful.

.Creating a trigger and inspecting it
----
$ wsk trigger create basics-alert
ok: created trigger alert
$ wsk trigger list
triggers
/openwhisk@example.com_dev/basics-alert                                     private
$ wsk trigger get basics-alert
ok: got trigger alert
{
    "namespace": "openwhisk@example.com_dev",
    "name": "basics-alert",
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "limits": {},
    "publish": false
}

[WARNING]
Triggers are a "namespace level" entity, and you cannot put them in a package.
