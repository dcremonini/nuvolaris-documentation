=  Triggers 

Now let's see what trigger is and how to use it. 

We can define a *trigger* as an object representing an event source that triggers the execution of *actions*. When activated by an event, associated actions are executed

In other words, a trigger is a mechanism that listens for specific events or conditions and initiates actions in response to those events. It acts as the starting point for a workflow.

Let's build now an example to see what triggers do. 
We use a simple action that does nothing except logging its activation. We use it to trace what is happening when you activate triggers. Note we start to construct the example now, but we complete it after we introduced rules, in the next paragraph.

== Example: Sending Slack Notifications When Users Visit Certain Pages on our website

Let's consider a scenario where we want to send Slack notifications when users visit specific pages on our website.

=== Step 1: Define the Trigger

We create a trigger named "PageVisitTrigger" that listens for events related to user visits on our website.

[source,yaml]
----
PageVisitTrigger:
  parameters:
    page: string
----
[NOTE]
Of course, there is not only `create` but also `update` and  `delete`, and they work as expected, updating and deleting triggers. In the next paragraph, we see also the `fire` command, that needs you first create rules to do something useful.

=== Step 2: Associate the Trigger with an Action
Next, we create an action named "SendSlackNotification" that sends a notification to Slack when invoked. We then associate this action with our "PageVisitTrigger" trigger, specifying that it should be triggered when users visit certain pages.

[source,yaml]
----
actions:
  SendSlackNotification:
    function: /actions/sendSlackNotification
  triggers:
    - name: PageVisitTrigger
      action: SendSlackNotification
      rules:
        - page: homepage
          url: /homepage
        - page: contact
          url: /contact
----

In this example, whenever a user visits either the homepage or the contact page, the "SendSlackNotification" action will be triggered, resulting in a Slack notification being sent.

== Conclusion

Triggers provide a flexible and scalable way to automate workflows based on various events. By defining triggers and associating them with actions, you can create powerful applications that respond dynamically to user interactions, system events, or any other specified conditions.
