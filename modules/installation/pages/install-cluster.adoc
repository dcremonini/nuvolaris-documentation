= Cluster Installation

This section describes how to install Nuvolaris on a Kubernetes Cluster

== Prerequisite

Before installing, you need to:

* xref:prereq-kubernetes.adoc[Provision] a Kubernetes Cluster
* xref:configure.adoc[Configure] the installation
* install xref:download.adoc[Download and install] Nuvolaris CLI, `nuv`.

== Installation

If you have a Kubernetes cluster directly accessible with its configuration, or you provisioned a cluster in some cloud using `nuv` embedded tools, you just need to type:

----
nuv setup cluster 
----

Sometimes the kubeconfig includes access to multiple Kubernetes instances, each one identified by a different `<context>` name. You can install the Nuvolaris cluster in a specified `<context>` with:

----
nuv setup cluster <context> 
----

== Post Install

* xref:tutorial:index.adoc[Check the tutorial] to learn how to use it.
* To uninstall, execute the command:

----
nuv setup cluster --uninstall
----
