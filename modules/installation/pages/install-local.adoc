= Local Installation

This page describes how to install Nuvolaris on your local machine. The services are limited and not accessible from the outside so it is an installation useful only for development purposes.

== Prerequisite

Before installing, you need to:

* install xref:prereq-docker.adoc[Docker].
* install xref:download.adoc[nuv].
* xref:configure.adoc[configure] the services you want

[NOTE]
====
You cannot have `https`` and static publishing in a local installation. If you enable them, the configuration will be ignored.
