== Deploy

To make available your application on your nuvolaris env, you can run this command on CLI from your web ide.
All the actions, packages and web folder files will be immediately available.

Now, if you go again into the admin at https://nuvolaris.dev, you'll see your actions and files saved inside

=== Instant deployment

So, if you try to edit some action or file, both from Admin env or from IDE and deploy it, code will be immediately available on your namespace env.

Using IDE, all will be available in local (on your dev container), every time you edit an action or your html files after that you type `devel` on CLI.

Here, a really simple example made in Svelte with `npm run build` directly on a namespace environment
