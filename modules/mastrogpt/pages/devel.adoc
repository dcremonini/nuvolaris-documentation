== Development

As mentioned in xref:/environment.adoc[environment], MastroGPT offer a complete developer suite, with functions and capabilities.

To start using it, simply click on `IDE` into your Admin env at https://nuvolaris.dev and choice a starter point to explore MastroGPT architecture.

In this example, we'll see a Wordpress demo, a simplified nuvolaris env from which you can develop both your backend functions and frontend html/css/js files.

=== From Ide, choice your starter

When you click on one of these starters (that you can see as ready to use templates) nuv will redirect you on a web IDE with a devcontainer inside, from which you can edit code and test it directly!

=== Devel

Once inside the web IDE, you'll be promped to enter `Task devel` or `Task deploy` via CLI. Task devel is a nuv feature that will create into your nuvolaris env packages, actions and web content (placed into web folder). 

So, if you enter `Task devel` or `devel`, a devcontainer will start and you'll see immediately via browser the output of this code.
