== Nuvolaris First Steps

=== Starting at the Front

Right now, after a freshly installation, if we visit the `<apihost>` you will see a very simple page 
with:
____
Welcome to Nuvolaris static content distributor landing page!!! 
____

That's because we've activated the static content, and by default it starts with this simple `index.html` page. We will instead have our own index page that shows the users a contact form powered by Nuvolaris actions. Let's write it now.

Let's create a folder that will contain all of our app code: `contact_us_app`. 

Inside that create a new folder called `web` which will store our static frontend, and add there a `index.html` file with the following:

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>

<head>
   <link href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" id="bootstrap-css">
</head>

<body>
   <div id="container">
      <div class="row">
         <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <h4>Get in Touch</h4>
            <form method="POST">
               <div class="form-group">
                  <input type="text" name="name" class="form-control" placeholder="Name">
               </div>
               <div class="form-group">
                  <input type="email" name="email" class="form-control" placeholder="E-mail">
               </div>
               <div class="form-group">
                  <input type="tel" name="phone" class="form-control" placeholder="Phone">
               </div>
               <div class="form-group">
                  <textarea name="message" rows="3" class="form-control" placeholder="Message"></textarea>
               </div>
               <button class="btn btn-default" type="submit" name="button">
                  Send
               </button>
            </form>
         </div>
      </div>
   </div>
</body>

</html>

Now we just have to upload it to our Nuvolaris deployment. You could upload it using something like `curl` with a `PUT` to where your platform is deployed at, but there is an handy command that does it automatically for all files in a folder:

[source,bash]
----
nuv web upload web/
----

Pass to `nuv web upload` the path to folder where the index.html is stored in (the `web` folder) and visit again `<apihost>`. 

Now you should see the new index page:

=== The Contact Package 

The contact form we just uploaded does not do anything. To make it work let's start by creating a new package to hold our actions. Moreover, we can bind to this package the database url, so the actions can directly access it!

With the `debug` command you can see what's going on in your deployment. This time let's use it to grab the "postgres_url" value:

[source,bash]
----
nuv -config -d | grep POSTGRES_URL
----

Copy the Postgres URL (something like `postgresql://...`). Now we can create a new package for the application:

[source,bash]
----
nuv package create contact -p dbUri <postgres_url>
ok: created package contact
----

The actions under this package will be able to access the "dbUri" variable from their args!

To follow the same structure for our action files, let's create a folder `packages` and inside another folder `contact` to give our actions a nice, easy to find, home.

==== 
To manage and check out your packages, you can use the `nuv packages` subcommands.

[source,bash]
----
nuv package list

packages
/nuvolaris/contact  private
/nuvolaris/hello    private     <-- a default package created during deployment
----

And to get specific information on a package:

[source,bash]
----
nuv package get contact

ok: got package contact
{
    "namespace": "nuvolaris",
    "name": "contact",
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "publish": false,
    "parameters": [
        {
            "key": "dbUri",
            "value": <postgres_url>
        }
    ],
    "binding": {},
    "updated": 1696232618540
}
